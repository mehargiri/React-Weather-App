## Overview

### The challenge

This web app displays variety of weather details about a given city.

Some of its features are:

- Current weather data such as current temperature, feels like temperature, visibility, wind speed, and direction
- 10 day forecast data which can be selected to reveal hourly weather data for each day
- Weather Icons that change according to weather condition
- Toggle between SI and Imperial units easily
- Search suggestions based on a given city name
- Horizontal scroll and button scroll

Open Meteo API is used to retrieve weather data as well as city names

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Third Party API (Open Meteo)

### What I learned

I learned how to use React's useRef hook to detect the scrollWidth changes in a window.

I learned how to use React's useEffect hook to perform side effects such as fetching third party data using the browser's built in fetch API.
I also learned about creating a debouncing function to reduce the total number of API calls.

I learned how to use Tailwind CSS to styles the various React Components easily.
